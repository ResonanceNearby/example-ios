# Resonance iOS SDK example app
#### Resonance Nearby allows you to detect nearby devices across all platforms: Web, iOS and Android.

This app demonstrates how to use Resonance iOS SDK.

## How this example works
After launch you will be prompted to input payload. Payload is the data that will be available to all
nearby devices. "START SEARCH" button starts the search. When nearby device is detected
line "Found: `another_payload`" will be printed to screen.
Search is stopped automatically when app is closed.

You can use this example with example-web and example-ios to see how cross-platform discovery works.

## Creating your own app
Detailed documentation, support and your API-key is available in [Resonance Console](https://console.getresonance.net) after registration.
